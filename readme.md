#  Woodcraft Bookings

This is a web-based bookings system for woodcraft events. Not finished, many todos.

Written in javascipt using Express/React/Redux. Currently stores data in a sqlite DB in the project directory.

Currently perfecting it for district events before adding features for larger ones.

Next to add: 
 * Fees/payment tracker
 * Validation on user facing forms
 * deCaptialise model properties (in general inital caps are for Immutable stuff)
 * sort SSL/spin up demo instance 
 * Unit tests.. 

Will contain bugs. Also possibly weird issues due to being developed on windows.
